Your goal is to generate questions that result in 'hard-to-vary' explanations - explanations that are tightly constrained by data and resist arbitrary modification.\n\n## Hard-to-Vary Explanation Definition\n\nA 'hard-to-vary' explanation has these essential characteristics:\n- Each component has a specific, data-constrained meaning\n- Components cannot be arbitrarily modified without breaking the explanation\n- The explanation is falsifiable by specific data conditions\n- It addresses potential cognitive biases and counterarguments preemptively\n\n## Your Task\nYou will generate questions that actively attempt to falsify the assumptions and hypotheses underlying a decision. For each decision scenario, provide:\n\n1. One primary question that directly tests the core decision hypothesis\n2. 3-4 refinement questions that test other critical assumptions\n\n## Resources\n{schema_path} = '../data/BIRD_table_schema_info.json'\n{stats_path} = '../data/compact_dataset_stats.json'\n{evidence_path} = '../data/all_evidence.json'\n{counterargument_patterns_path} = '../resources/question_guide_pillars/preemptive-counterargument_pattern.json'\n\n## Step-by-Step Falsification Process\n\n### STAGE 1: HYPOTHESIS EXTRACTION AND FORMALIZATION\n1.1 Extract the implicit and explicit hypotheses in the decision:\n   - What causal claims are being made?\n   - What correlational relationships are assumed?\n   - What predictions about outcomes are implied?\n   - What mechanisms of action are proposed?\n\n1.2 Formalize each hypothesis in falsifiable form:\n   - Convert general claims to specific, testable statements\n   - Identify specific metrics that would measure the effect\n   - Specify thresholds or conditions that would confirm/refute\n   - Define the scope and boundary conditions\n\n1.3 Rank hypotheses by criticality:\n   - Which hypotheses, if false, would most undermine the decision?\n   - Which assumptions carry the most risk?\n   - Which claims have the least prior evidence?\n   - Which hypotheses are easiest to test with available data?\n\n### STAGE 2: FALSIFIABLE PREDICTION IDENTIFICATION\n2.1 For each critical hypothesis, identify specific predictions:\n   - If hypothesis H is true, then we should observe X in the data\n   - If mechanism M operates, then relationship R should hold\n   - If assumption A is valid, then condition C should be present\n\n2.2 For each prediction, specify:\n   - Exactly what data pattern would confirm it\n   - Exactly what data pattern would falsify it\n   - What strength of evidence would be convincing\n   - What potential confounds might explain the same pattern\n\n2.3 Focus on predictions that have maximum falsification power:\n   - The prediction is a necessary consequence of the hypothesis\n   - The prediction is specific and unambiguous\n   - The prediction is unlikely to occur by chance\n   - The prediction differentiates between competing explanations\n\n### STAGE 3: CRITICAL TEST DESIGN\n3.1 For each key prediction, design a critical test:\n   - What specific analysis would provide the strongest test?\n   - What control variables are needed?\n   - What subgroups or conditions should be compared?\n   - What statistical criteria should be applied?\n\n3.2 Prioritize tests with these characteristics:\n   - Severe tests that give the hypothesis a real chance to fail\n   - Tests that control for obvious alternative explanations\n   - Tests that are robust to data quality issues\n   - Tests that require minimal assumptions themselves\n\n3.3 For each test, document:\n   - Null and alternative hypotheses\n   - Required data elements\n   - Analytical approach\n   - Interpretation guidelines\n\n### STAGE 4: FALSIFICATION QUESTION FORMULATION\n4.1 For the primary question:\n   - Focus on the most critical hypothesis\n   - Structure the question as a direct falsification attempt\n   - Ensure the question can be answered with available data\n\n4.2 For refinement questions:\n   - Target different critical hypotheses or assumptions\n   - Structure each question as a distinct falsification test\n   - Vary the type of test (e.g., direct test, edge case test, assumption test)\n   - Ensure complementarity across the question set\n\n4.3 For each question, include:\n   - The specific hypothesis being tested\n   - The prediction being examined\n   - The falsification approach being used\n   - The data elements required\n\n### STAGE 5: FALSIFICATION COVERAGE OPTIMIZATION\n5.1 Evaluate each candidate question on:\n   - Falsification power (High/Medium/Low)\n   - Hypothesis criticality (High/Medium/Low)\n   - Data answerability (High/Medium/Low)\n   - Uniqueness (High/Medium/Low)\n\n5.2 Select the final set of questions:\n   - One primary question testing the core hypothesis\n   - 3-4 refinement questions that test other critical assumptions\n   - Ensure questions collectively test the most risky assumptions\n\n5.3 Final question refinement:\n   - Make each question specific and precise\n   - Explicitly reference relevant data elements\n   - Structure questions to maximize falsification power\n   -

Your primary goal is to formulate insightful, data-driven questions that lead to robust, \"hard-to-vary\" explanations, enabling better decision-making. You will be provided with a decision scenario, database schema information, and relevant statistical metadata. Your questions should be directly translatable into SQL queries against the provided database.\n\n## Hard-to-Vary Explanation Definition\n\nA \"hard-to-vary\" explanation has these essential characteristics:\n- **Data-Constrained:** Each component relies on specific, verifiable data points.\n- **Non-Arbitrary:** Components cannot be easily changed without invalidating the explanation.\n- **Falsifiable:** The explanation can be disproven by specific data conditions.\n- **Bias-Aware:** It proactively addresses potential cognitive biases and counterarguments.\n- **Decision-Focused:** Directly informs the decision at hand, considering practical implications.\n\n### Good Example of Hard-to-Vary Explanation:\n**Decision**: Allocate marketing budget to social media platform X.\n**Hard-to-vary explanation**: \"Platform X has a 25-34 year old user demographic that overlaps with our target audience, a click-through rate 1.5x higher than other platforms, and a cost-per-click 20% lower. This makes it the most efficient platform for reaching our target demographic. This explanation is hard-to-vary because changing the demographic, click-through rate, or cost-per-click would significantly weaken the rationale. It's falsifiable - data could show the conversion rate on platform X is significantly lower, negating the lower CPC.\"\n\n### Poor Example (Easy-to-Vary Explanation):\n**Decision**: Allocate marketing budget to social media platform X.\n**Explanation**: \"Platform X is popular and will reach a lot of people.\"\nThis is easy to vary - \"popular\" and \"a lot of people\" are undefined and lack data constraints.

Consider potential confounding variables, reverse causality, and selection bias.\n3.  **Formulate the Primary Question:** Craft a clear, concise question that directly addresses the core decision need. Ensure this question can be answered with a SQL query against the available database.\n4.  **Generate Refinement Questions:**\n    -   **Toulmin Argument Structure:** Frame each question as a component of a Toulmin argument (claim, data, warrant, backing, qualifier, rebuttal). For example, a question could serve as evidence supporting the claim, while another could address a potential counterargument.\n    -   **Data Constraints:** Ensure each question is tightly constrained by the available data and can be answered with a specific SQL query. Prioritize data elements directly related to the decision-maker and the decision process.\n    -   **Bias Mitigation:** Explicitly state how each question mitigates a specific bias or addresses a potential vulnerability. Consider biases related to data interpretation, motivation attribution, and risk assessment.\n    -   **Counterarguments:** Actively consider potential counterarguments to the decision and formulate questions that directly address those counterarguments. Explore alternative explanations and seek disconfirming evidence.\n    -   **Causal Exploration:** Explore potential causal mechanisms that might explain observed relationships. Propose potential causal pathways and formulate questions to test those pathways.\n    -   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Formulate at least one question that directly compares the costs and benefits of different decision options.\n    -   **Strategic Context:** Consider the broader strategic context of the decision, such as the value of the service, audience relevance, and potential return on investment.\n    -   **Temporal Dimension:** Explore the change in relevant metrics before and after a specific event (e.g., policy change, budget allocation).\n    -   **Qualitative Insights:** Consider how the question could be answered through direct communication with stakeholders (e.g., survey, interview). Formulate questions that *could* be asked to directly understand their rationale.\n    -   **External Factors:** Identify and document relevant external factors (economic conditions, competitor actions, market trends) that could influence the decision outcome. Explore the potential impact of these external factors.\n5.  **Optimize Question Set:**\n    -   Ensure the refinement questions build upon each other in a logical sequence, creating a cohesive argument.\n    -   Eliminate redundant questions and ensure each question addresses a unique aspect of the decision context.\n    -   Prioritize decision relevance over comprehensiveness.\n\n## Example Questions\n\n**Decision:** Should we offer a special service to clients who choose weekly statements?\n\n**Good Question:** \"What is the average revenue generated by clients who opt for weekly statements compared to those who receive monthly statements, and is the difference statistically significant (p < 0.05)? This question addresses potential selection bias by comparing revenue across groups and uses a statistical test to determine significance.\"\n\n**Poor Question:** \"Do clients like weekly statements?\" (Too vague, not data-driven, and doesn't directly inform the decision).\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour output should be a JSON object with the following fields:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"primary_question\": \"string\",\n  \"refinement_questions\": [\n    {\n      \"question\": \"string\",\n      \"toulmin_component\": \"claim | data | warrant | backing | qualifier | rebuttal\",\n      \"bias_mitigation_explanation\": \"string\",\n      \"sql_query_potential\": \"string\",\n      \"potential_counterarguments\": \"string\",\n      \"causal_mechanism_exploration\": \"string\",\n      \"cost_benefit_consideration\": \"string\",\n      \"strategic_considerations\": \"string\",\n      \"temporal_dimension\": \"string\",\n      \"qualitative_insights\": \"string\",\n      \"external_factors\": \"string\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nRemember to use the provided database schema and statistical metadata to formulate specific, data-constrained questions that lead to hard-to-vary explanations and better decisions."}"

Are certain types of users or content systematically favored by the platform's algorithms? How does the weighting of different data points affect the representation of different groups?\n\n2.4 Explore potential reasons and incentives for the observed patterns. What potential reasons might explain the member's behavior? What incentives could have influenced their actions?\n\n### STAGE 3: DATA STRUCTURE VALIDATION\nIdentify only the most decision-relevant data patterns:\n{json.dumps(schema_categories, indent=2)}\n\n3.1 Map critical decision factors to specific database elements:\n   - Identify the exact tables containing decision-relevant data\n   - List the precise columns needed for analysis\n   - Determine join conditions required to connect relevant data\n\n3.2 Assess data quality for decision-critical fields:\n   - For columns flagged as high_null_numeric: \"How would results change if NULLs were handled by [specific alternative methods]?\"\n   - For imbalanced columns: \"Does the analysis hold when controlling for the imbalance in [column]?\"\n   - For skewed distributions: \"How do results differ when using median vs. mean for [column]?\"\n\n3.3 Validate data sufficiency:\n   - Formulate questions that verify whether enough data exists for reliable analysis\n   - Address potential sampling bias or coverage issues\n   - Check for time period consistency and completeness\n\n3.4 Explore potential data entry errors, such as misspellings or variations in the data fields. Use string similarity or fuzzy matching techniques to identify potential inconsistencies.\n\n### STAGE 4: ARGUMENT STRENGTHENING (Toulmin Analysis)\nIdentify the weakest component in the decision argument chain:\n{json.dumps(toulmin_components, indent=2)}\n\n4.1 Analyze the Toulmin argument structure for this decision:\n   - Claim: What is being asserted?\n   - Evidence: What data directly supports this?\n   - Warrant: What reasoning connects evidence to the claim?\n   - Backing: What supports the warrant itself?\n   - Qualifier: What limits the scope or certainty?\n   - Rebuttal: What conditions would invalidate the claim?\n\n4.2 Identify the 1-2 weakest components in this structure:\n   - Formulate a question that directly strengthens this component\n   - Explain exactly how answering this question would reinforce the argument\n   - Ensure the question is answerable with available data\n\n4.3 Example argument-strengthening questions:\n   - For weak evidence: \"What is the statistical significance of the difference between [control] and [treatment]?\"\n   - For weak warrant: \"Do we see the same relationship between [X] and [Y] across all subgroups, or only in specific cases?\"\n   - For weak backing: \"What previous research or historical patterns support our assumption that [X]?\"\n   - For weak claim: \"What are the limitations of the claim, and under what conditions might it not hold true?\"\n\n### STAGE 5: COUNTER-ARGUMENT TESTING\nIdentify the strongest potential challenge to the decision:\n{json.dumps(counterargument_categories, indent=2)}\n\n5.1 Consider these categories of potential counter-arguments:\n   - Conclusion rebuttals: Alternative outcomes from the same evidence\n   - Premise rebuttals: Challenges to the factual basis or data\n   - Argument undercutters: Flaws in the reasoning chain\n   - Framing challenges: Alternative ways to conceptualize the problem\n\n5.2 Select the most formidable counter-argument:\n   - Determine what data would be needed to test this counter-argument\n   - Formulate a precise question that directly addresses this challenge\n   - Ensure the question can be answered using available data\n\n5.3 Example counter-argument testing questions:\n   - \"If we segment the data by [alternative factor], does the primary relationship still hold?\"\n   - \"What happens to our conclusion if we exclude outliers above the 95th percentile?\"\n   - \"Is there a non-linear relationship between [X] and [Y] that our analysis is missing?\"\n   - \"Are there alternative explanations for the observed patterns that we haven't considered?\"\n   - \"What are the potential unintended consequences of this decision?\"\n\n### STAGE 6: TEMPORAL ANALYSIS AND TREND VALIDATION\n6.1 Identify time-based patterns critical to the decision:\n   - Formulate questions that explore how key metrics have changed over time\n   - Consider seasonality, growth rates, or pattern shifts\n   - Look for inflection points or discontinuities\n\n6.2 Example trend validation questions:\n   - \"Has the correlation between [X] and [Y] strengthened or weakened over the past [time period]?\"\n   - \"At what point did [metric] begin to show significant change, and what other factors changed at that time?\"\n   - \"Are the observed patterns consistent across different time scales (daily, monthly, yearly)?\"\n   - What was the change in a relevant metric *before* and *after* a specific event (e.g., policy change, budget allocation)?\n\n### STAGE 7: QUESTION SET OPTIMIZATION\n**Critical:** Produce a minimal set of questions by:\n\n7.1 Evaluate each candidate question on these dimensions:\n   - **Decision impact**: How significantly would the answer change the decision? (High/Medium/Low)\n   - **Answerability**: How directly can it be answered with available data? (High/Medium/Low)\n   - **Uniqueness**: Does it provide insight not covered by other questions? (High/Medium/Low)\n   - **Bias mitigation**: Does it address a critical cognitive vulnerability? (High/Medium/Low)\n   - **Causal Identification Strength**: Does the question explicitly state the assumptions required for the chosen identification strategy to be valid?\n\n7.2 Prioritize questions with the highest combined score across these dimensions\n   - Retain only the top 4 questions that collectively provide the most decision value\n   - Ensure at least one question from each critical pillar is included\n   - Apply a self-critique to each final question: \"How might this question fail to produce useful insight?\"\n   - Revise questions that fail this critique\n\n7.3 Final check:\n   - Verify each question is directly answerable with SQL queries\n   - Ensure each question has a clear, unique purpose\n   - Confirm the set collectively builds toward a hard-to-vary explanation\n   - Ensure that the data elements referenced in the questions are actually present in the schema.\n   - Ensure that each refinement question utilizes a distinct data element or addresses a unique aspect of the decision context not covered by other questions.\n\n## Response Format\nProvide your response as a JSON array, with one object for each dataset entry:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"dataset_id\": 1,\n    \"bird_id\": 101,\n    \"original_question\": \"The user's original question\",\n    \"decision_context\": \"The user's decision context\",\n    \"primary_question\": {\n      \"question\": \"The most direct, specific question formulation that precisely addresses the core decision need\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of how this addresses the core decision need\"\n    },\n    \"refinement_questions\": [\n      {\n        \"question\": \"A precise, specific question formulation (not broad or general).
